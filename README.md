**COVID-19 Analysis Using MySQL**

This project analyzes COVID-19 data from various countries over multiple years using MySQL. The dataset includes details about cases, deaths, and vaccinations to observe trends and insights.

CovidDeaths.csv – Contains information on COVID-19 cases and deaths across different countries.
CovidVaccinations.csv – Includes data on vaccination rates worldwide.

**Analyses Performed are:**

**COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Analysis (1. Covid Deaths.sql)**
Total cases and deaths by country, 
Death percentage per country, 
Global death rate comparison, 

**Vaccination Analysis (2. Covid Vaccinations.sql)**
Total vaccinations administered per country, 
Percentage of population vaccinated, 
Trends in vaccination over time, 

**Combining COVID & Vaccination Data (3. Covid - JOIN_tables.sql)**
Case trends vs. vaccination rates, 
Impact of vaccines on reducing cases, 

**Population vs. Vaccination Analysis (4. PopVsVac.sql & 5. PopVsVac_View.sql)**
Percentage of population vaccinated per country, 
Population size and vaccination rollout. 

**Discovered that:**
Countries with higher vaccination rates saw a reduction in new cases over time.
Death rates varied significantly across regions, likely due to healthcare disparities.
Some countries had slower vaccine rollouts, impacting their COVID-19 trends.

This analysis will be extended further using **Tableau** for data visualization and deeper insights.
