**Population vs. Vaccination Analysis**  
Percentage of population vaccinated per country,   
Population size and vaccination rollout.   

**Discovered that:**  
Countries with higher vaccination rates saw a reduction in new cases over time.  
Death rates varied significantly across regions, likely due to healthcare disparities.  
Some countries had slower vaccine rollouts, impacting their COVID-19 trends.  

This analysis will be extended further using **Tableau** for data visualization and deeper insights.
